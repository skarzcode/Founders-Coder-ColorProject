Color Palette

# Color Palette

**A color palette project made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to choose colors and create their own custom color palettes. The HTML provides the structure and layout of the project, while the CSS handles the styling and visual presentation. The JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality, allowing users to select colors and save their palette creations. With this project, users can easily experiment with different color combinations and find the perfect palette for their needs.**



## Applying Learning Progress

The color palette project was created as a way to combine and apply all of the knowledge and skills gained from working on the pre course project during the application phase. By working on a real-world project, students such as I were able to take the concepts learned in the course and apply them in a practical setting, helping to solidify their understanding and prepare them for future projects. The project also provided an opportunity for students to get creative and explore different color combinations, allowing them to further develop their skills and abilities. Overall, the color palette project was a valuable learning experience that helped students to integrate and apply the knowledge they gained during the course.
